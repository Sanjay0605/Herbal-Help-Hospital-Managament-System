delete or insert a column in between two different columns in a table
quickly search how to do that

using sql queries??
not necessarily
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name;

ALTER TABLE table_name ADD column_name data_type AFTER existing_column_name;

SELECT prescription FROM prestb WHERE disease = 'your_disease_name';  WORKS this one

ALTER TABLE prestb DROP COLUMN apptime;
   |
ALTER TABLE prestb ADD address VARCHAR AFTER allergy;


ALTER TABLE prestb DROP COLUMN apptime;

emancod'=rotcod erehw e

leave this i got it  ...in backend it worked do front enhanced

aevrything came back. okat good. now what needs to be done?
bronow i ll show her until where i have finished

bro its only showing one result i need. a ll of 
them
LISTENNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNnn
when u say only 1 result do u mean its only showing for ashok or do u mean its only showing one patient of whatever name of the doctor youre inserting
see
see when i search ashok its givingonly 1 entry of ashok
lsiten go to doctor seaerch

instead of search by contact  make it search by doctor name 
and should  give all the paitent names ...do same thing as yesterday where it shows all reesults but search shoukd be by docator name


did us see????


SELECT * FROM appointmenttb where doctor='ashok';

first tell me when u search for some other doctor does that show also?
need clarity on this first
does it only work for ashok or others too


update?
